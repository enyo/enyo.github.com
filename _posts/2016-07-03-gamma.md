I recently worked on a design in Photoshop and encountered a very annoying problem that rendered all blending colors
way darker than they should be. So I looked into what the cause of this problem could be, and after some long and
interesting research I discovered that gamma correction (well... the way nearly all image editing apps handle gamma
correction) was to blame.   
\* Disclaimer: Gamma correction may not actually be ruining your life.

# What's the problem?

A simple image is best to showcase the problem that gamma correction can cause.

<div class="image-comparison backdrop dark">
<div class="side-by-side"><div class="side bad" markdown="1">

![Bad circle](/images/posts/bad-gamma.png)

</div><div class="side good" markdown="1">

![Good circle](/images/posts/good-gamma.png)

</div></div>

<p>
  Both images are generated with the exact same properties and shadows. The only difference is that one uses
  proper gamma correction, and the other doesn't.

</div>
