So, I finally released my blog! Yay...

The biggest question was: what technology should I use. I initially wanted to
write my own software with nodejs but realised quickly that I will spend more
time working on the blog software itself than writing blog entries. And since
there are already lots of good frameworks out there I didn't even have the
ambition of creating a new one.
