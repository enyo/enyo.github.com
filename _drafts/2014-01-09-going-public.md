Since apparently every major intelligence agency on the world is in on my
thoughts, I figured, why not share them with other people as well.

This is the first draft of my website. I have been thinking of creating a
website for about two years now, and have created about five different layouts
for it, but never got to the point where I actually created it. Recently many
people and companies started contacting me because of my open source projects
and I realised, once again, that I have already many followers online, but no
actual content to share.


Technology used
---------------

I built the site with Jekyll, Stylus and Dart.
